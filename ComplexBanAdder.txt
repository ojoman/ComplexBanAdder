  /**
   * Complex Ban Setter V1.5
   * ojoman 2023
   * 
   * Google Apps Script function to automatically place complex bans onto a tierlist
   * WARNING: This script will clear **ALL** notes on your tierlist sheet.
   *          This can be set to clear a range instead of the whole sheet but you'll need to do that yourself
   * 
   * DISCLAIMER: This script will not place multiple bans on the same pokemon (for example, greninja having
   *             different tiers for ash, protean and torrent). You will need the pokemon to have different names
   * 
   * Setup:
   * Change the four below variables to match your own draft document
   * On your document, click "Extensions -> Apps Script"
   * Paste this function into the app script (replacing the default if present)
   * Return to your document, click "Extensions -> Macros -> Import Macro"
   * Click "Add Function" and close the dialog
   * Click "Extensions -> Macros -> complex_bans"
   * Click "Ok" to the "Authorisation Required" dialog
   * Sign in and click "advanced" on the security dialog
   * Click "Go to Untitled project (unsafe)" 
   * Click "Allow"
   * Run the script again ("Extensions -> Macros -> complex_bans")
